I'm a fourth-year (incoming 4B) Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo in the class of 2023.

I love all aspects about Software Engineering and plan to explore as much as I can throughout my education.

I'm always working on something new! See my [GitHub](https://github.com/ZacJoffe) or the [Projects](/projects) section of the site for more.

In my spare time, I enjoy programming, keyboards, [Hi-Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/), video games, and occasionally drinking craft beer.
